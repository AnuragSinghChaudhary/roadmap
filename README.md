# Daneel Product Roadmap

## Summary
> So far :
> A big-data system collecting 1 M entries per day, analyzing in real-time the crypto market.
> A smart assistant able to answer to user on every question related to a project, and ICO, events, prices, news, and many more. Daneel's training continues every day: it is enhanced by questions from all users of the platform.
> The ability to learn with Daneel by asking educational questions : “What is Blockchain ?”.
> The power of A.I and Machine Learning at your service : insights, trends, market sentiment, and price predictions.
> Daneel in your hand with the mobile application (currently in closed alpha test).
